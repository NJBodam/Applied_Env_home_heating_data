Applied Environmental Economics: Homework

16.4 Using home heating data, complete the following.
a. Estimate a model that includes only the installation and operating cost vari-
ables, and check that you are able to replicate the estimates shown in exercise 16.3.

b. Estimate a model that includes the operating and installation cost variables,
as well as the full set of J-1 alternative speci c constants (ASCs). Comment
on the di erences in the estimates relative to part (a). How does inclusion of
the ASCs a ect the estimate of the marginal willingness to pay for a change
in installation cost? What is the likely explanation for the di erences?

c. Now consider the role of income in explaining choices. Specify a model that
allows you to test whether higher income households are more or less likely
to install a central (as opposed to room) heating system (i.e., more likely
to select option j = 1; 2; 3). Run your model with and without ASCs, and
comment on the di erences.

d. Consider a situation in which a 15 % of installation cost rebate is being
o ered when a heat pump is selected. Using the model with oc_{ij} , ic_{ij} , and
the full set of ASCs, predict how the average probability of a household
selecting the heat pump changes due to the rebate.

e. Using the same model as in (d), calculate the sample average willingness to
pay for the rebate program. Compare your predictions for observations 3, 14,
and 21 to what you derived in exercise 16.3. Which of the two calculations
you  nd most plausible? Explain your reasoning.
